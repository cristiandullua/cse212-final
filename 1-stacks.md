# Stacks

A stack is a structure made up of elements of the same type. This structure has the distinctive characteristic that it operates under the principle of "Last In - First Out" (often known as LIFO). This common operations are commonly named push to add elements to the stack and pop to remove elements from the stack. The concept of stack is used in programming and also in computer memory.In Python we can implement this concept of a Stack by using a list.
